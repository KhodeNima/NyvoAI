## Style guide
---
> **Organizing the project in a way that we would be unneedy to discuss about the methods for categorizing it Is a solid factor to look at.
> While it's solid, It is needed, As we don't want to waste the precious energy of our dear contributers on understanding each others routine,
> Instead, we arranged a certain routine for constructing the project that would erect it in a ordinary and conventional way, So we can all
> know how to treat our child, NyvoAI Project. As it relates to the matter of organizing our child by conventions, We respectfully request your consideration
> In reading [NyvoStudio Style guide documentation](https://github.com/KhodeNima/NyvoAI/tree/Main.Project/documentations/style_guide/main).**
